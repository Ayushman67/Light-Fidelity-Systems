# Light-Fidelity-Systems

Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are used in different areas of 
everyday life. The advantage of this device is that in addition 
to their lightening capabilities, it can be used for data 
transmissions as well. In this project, we have made an 
exhaustive study on technology of Li-Fi and its applications in 
transferring data. We have tried to learn the future scope of 
this new technology for using visible light as the carrier in 
data transmission and networking through this project.
